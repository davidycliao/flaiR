Description: This is an R wrapper designed to provide access to the primary 
             features of Flair in Python. FlairNLP is a potent framework for 
             state-of-the-art natural language processing and sequence tagging.
             flaiR offers features such as part-of-speech tagging, 
             transformer-based sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. 
             This package requires Python 3.8 or higher to function properly.
