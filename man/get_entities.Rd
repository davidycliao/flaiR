\title{Extract Named Entities from Texts with Batch Processing}
\usage{
get_entities(
  texts,
  doc_ids = NULL,
  tagger,
  show.text_id = FALSE,
  gc.active = FALSE,
  batch_size = 5,
  device = "cpu",
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{texts}{A character vector containing the texts to process.}

\item{doc_ids}{A character or numeric vector containing the document IDs
corresponding to each text.}

\item{tagger}{A Flair tagger object for named entity recognition. Must be provided
by the user. Can be created using load_tagger_ner() with different models:
\itemize{
\item Standard NER: tagger_ner <- load_tagger_ner('ner')
\item OntoNotes: tagger_ner <- load_tagger_ner('flair/ner-english-ontonotes')
\item Large model: tagger_ner <- load_tagger_ner('flair/ner-english-large')
}}

\item{show.text_id}{A logical value. If TRUE, includes the actual text from
which the entity was extracted. Default is FALSE.}

\item{gc.active}{A logical value. If TRUE, runs the garbage collector after
processing texts. Default is FALSE.}

\item{batch_size}{An integer specifying the size of each batch. Set to 1 for
single-text processing. Default is 5.}

\item{device}{A character string specifying the computation device ("cpu",
"cuda:0", "cuda:1", etc.). Default is "cpu". Note: MPS (Mac M1/M2) is currently
not fully supported and will default to CPU.}

\item{verbose}{A logical value. If TRUE, prints processing progress. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A data table with columns:
\describe{
\item{doc_id}{Character or numeric. The ID of the document from which the
entity was extracted.}
\item{text_id}{Character. The complete text from which the entity was
extracted. Only included when show.text_id = TRUE.}
\item{entity}{Character. The actual named entity text that was extracted.
Will be NA if no entity was found.}
\item{tag}{Character. The category of the named entity.}
\item{score}{Numeric. Confidence score of the prediction.}
}
}
\description{
This function processes texts in batches and extracts named entities
using the Flair NLP library. It supports both standard NER and OntoNotes models,
with options for batch processing and GPU acceleration.
