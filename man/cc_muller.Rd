\description{
The replication data is sourced from "The Temporal Focus of Campaign
Communication," authored by Stefan MÃ¼ller, and was published in the Journal of Politics in 2022.
This study primarily delves into the temporal emphasis of party manifestos. The dataset
encompasses 5,858 annotated data entries from countries such as the United Kingdom,
Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Its central objective
is to compute the percentage of sentences or quasi-sentences referring to the past, present,
or future. This differentiation is made based on two categories: "Prospective" and "Retrospective".
