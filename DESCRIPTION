Description: flaiR is an R wrapper designed to provide access to the primary 
             features of Flair in Python. FlairNLP is an advanced framework for 
             state-of-the-art natural language processing and sequence tagging. 
             flaiR offers features such as part-of-speech tagging, transformer-based 
             sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition. 
             To function properly, flaiR requires Python 3.7 or higher.
