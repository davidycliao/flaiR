Description: This is an R wrapper based on the structure of reticulate, designed 
             to access the major features of flairNLP in Python. Flair NLP is a 
             straightforward framework for state-of-the-art Natural Language 
             Processing. The stable features currently include part-of-speech 
             tagging, sentiment tagging, and named entity recognition tagging. 
             This package requires Python 3.8 to operate concurrently.
