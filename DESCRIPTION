Description: This is an R wrapper, based on the structure of R's reticulate, 
             designed to access the major features of flairNLP in Python. 
             FlairNLP is a powerful framework for state-of-the-art natural 
             language processing and sequence tagging. The features in flaiR 
             currently include part-of-speech (POS) tagging, transformer-based 
             sentiment tagging, and named entity recognition (NER) tagging. 
             This package requires Python 3.8 or above to operate concurrently.
