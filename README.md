# `flairR`: An R Wrapper for Accessing Flair NLP Tagging Features

This R wrapper, built upon the reticulate architecture, offers streamlined access to the core features of FlairNLP in Python. FlairNLP is an advanced framework incorporating the latest techniques in Natural Language Processing. For a deeper understanding of Flair's training model architecture, please consult the article '[Contextual String Embeddings for Sequence Labeling](https://aclanthology.org/C18-1139.pdf)'. The stable features currently available in `flairR` includes __part-of-speech tagging__, __transformer-based sentiment analysis__, and __named entity recognition__. The utility of flairR is confined to the pre-trained models provided by _Flair NLP_. flairR directly return the taaging information into a data.table format.
