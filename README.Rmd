__flaiR__ is an R package for accessing the [flairNLP/flair](flairNLP/flair) Python library, maintained by [Yen-ChiehLiao](https://davidycliao.github.io) ([University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centres-institutes/centre-for-artificial-intelligence-in-government)) and  [Stefan Müller](https://muellerstefan.net) from [Next Generation Energy Systems](https://www.nexsys-energy.ie) and [Text and Policy Research Group](https://text-and-policy.com) in UCD. flaiR provides convenient access to the main functionalities of flairNLP for training word embedding-based deep learning models and fine-tune state-of-the-art transformers hosted on Hugging Face. Our team trains and fine-tunes the models with Flair in [our projects]().

## Requirements 

<div style="text-align: justify">

__flaiR__ runs the Flair NLP backend in Python, thus requiring Python installation. We have extensively tested flaiR using CI/CD with GitHub Actions, conducting integration tests across various operating systems. These tests includes integration between R versions ~~4.2.1~~, 4.3.2, and 4.2.0, along with Python 3.9 and 3.10.x. Additionally, the testing includes environments with PyTorch, Flair NLP, and their dependencies in both R and Python. For stable usage, we strongly recommend installing these specific versions.

| OS      | R Versions                 | Python Version |
|---------|----------------------------|----------------|
| Mac     | 4.3.2, 4.2.0, ~~4.2.1~~*   | 3.10.x         |
| Mac     | Latest                     | 3.9            |
| Windows | 4.0.5                      | 3.10.x         |
| Windows | Latest                     | 3.9            |
| Ubuntu  | 4.3.2, 4.2.0, 4.2.1        | 3.10.x         |
| Ubuntu  | Latest                     | 3.9            |

*: _On R 4.2.1, especially on Mac M1/M2, compatibility issues with `gfortran` may occur._
