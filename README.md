`{flaiR}` is an R wrapper for the
[{flairNLP/flair}](https://github.com/flairnlp/flair) library in Python,
designed specifically for R users, especially those in the social
sciences. It provides easy access to the main functionalities of
`{flairNLP}`. Developed by Developed by [Zalando
Research](https://engineering.zalando.com/posts/2018/11/zalando-research-releases-flair.html)
in Berlin, Flair NLP offers intuitive interfaces and exceptional
multilingual support, particularly for various embedding frameworks and
state-of-the-art natural language processing models to analyze your
text, such as named entity recognition, sentiment analysis,
part-of-speech tagging, biomedical data, sense disambiguation, and
classification, with support for a rapidly growing number of languages
in the community. For a comprehensive understanding of the
`{flairNLP/flair}` architecture, you can refer to the research article
â€˜[Contextual String Embeddings for Sequence
Labeling](https://aclanthology.org/C18-1139.pdf)â€™ and the official
[manual](https://flairnlp.github.io) written for its Python
implementation.

## Installation via <u>**`GitHub`**</u>

<div style="text-align: justify">

The installation consists of two parts: First, install [Python
3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher (avoid developmental
versions and the very latest release for compatibility reasons).
Secondly, install [R 4.2.0](https://www.r-project.org) or higher.

**System Requirement:**

- Python (\>= 3.10.x)

- R (\>= 4.2.0)

- RStudio ***(The GUI interface allows users to adjust and manage the
  Python environment in R)***

- Anaconda ***(highly recommended)***

We have tested flaiR using CI/CD with GitHub Actions, conducting
integration tests across [various operating
syste](https://github.com/davidycliao/flaiR/actions) These tests include
intergration between R versions 4.2.1, 4.3.2, and 4.2.0 and Python
3.10.x. The testing also covers environments with flair NLP and PyTorch
(given that [Flair NLP](https://flairnlp.github.io) is built on
[Torch](https://pytorch.org)). For stable usage, we strongly recommend
installing these specific versions.

When first installed, {`flaiR`} automatically detects whether you have
Python 3.8 or higher. If not, it will skip the automatic installation of
Python and flair NLP. In this case, you will need to manually install it
yourself and reload {`flaiR`} again. If you have correct
Pythoninstalled, the {`flaiR`} will automatically install flair Python
NLP in your global environment. If you are using {reticulate}, {flaiR}
will typically assume the **r-reticulate** environment by default. At
the same time, you can use `py_config()` to check the location of your
environment. Please note that flaiR will directly install flair NLP in
the Python environment that your R is using. This environment can be
adjusted through *RStudio* by navigating to
**`Tools -> Global Options -> Python`**. If there are any issues with
the installation, feel free to ask in the
<u>[Discussion](https://github.com/davidycliao/flaiR/discussions) </u>.

First, understanding which Python environment your RStudio is using is
very important. We advise you to confirm which Python environment
RStudio is using. You can do this by checking with
`reticulate::py_config()` or manually via **Tools -\> Global Options -\>
Python**.

``` r
install.packages("reticulate")
reticulate::py_config()
```

At this stage, youâ€™ll observe that RStudio has defaulted to using the
â€˜flair_envâ€™ environment I have set up. Consequently, the Python Flair
package will be installed within this environment. Should you wish to
modify this setting, you have the option to either adjust it within
RStudioâ€™s settings or utilize the {reticulate} package to manage the
Python environment in RStudio.

``` shell
#> python:         /Users/*********/.virtualenvs/flair_env/bin/python
#> libpython:      /Users/*********/.pyenv/versions/3.10.13/lib/libpython3.10.dylib
#> pythonhome:     /Users/*********/.virtualenvs/flair_env:/Users/*********/.virtualenvs/flair_env
#> version:        3.10.13 (main, Oct 27 2023, 04:44:16) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.0.40.1)]
#> numpy:          /Users/*********/.virtualenvs/flair_env/lib/python3.10/site-packages/numpy
#> numpy_version:  1.26.2
#> flair:          /Users/*********/.virtualenvs/flair_env/lib/python3.10/site-packages/flair

#> NOTE: Python version was forced by use_python() function
```

Now, you can confidently install flaiR in your R environment.

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("davidycliao/flaiR", force = TRUE)
```

You will notice the following message, indicating a successful
installation. This means that your RStudio has successfully detected the
correct Python and has installed Flair in your Python environment

``` r
library(flaiR)
#> flaiR: An R Wrapper for Accessing Flair NLP 0.13.0
```

## Introduction

<div style="text-align: justify">

For R users, {`flairR`} primarily consists of two main components. The
first is wrapper functions in {`flaiR`} built on top of {`reticulate`},
which enables you to interact directly with Python modules in R and
provides seamless support for documents and [tutorial (in
progress)](https://davidycliao.github.io/flaiR/articles/tutorial.html)
in the R community. The {flaiR} package enables R users to leverage
Flairâ€™s capabilities to train their own models using the Flair framework
and state-of-the-art NLP models without the need to interact directly
with Python.

Flair offers a simpler and more intuitive approach for training custom
NLP models compared to using Transformer-based models directly. With
Flair, data loading and preprocessing are streamlined, facilitating the
easy integration of various pre-trained embeddings, including both
traditional and Transformer-based types like BERT. The training process
in Flair is condensed to just a few lines of code, with automatic
handling of fundamental preprocessing steps. Evaluation and optimization
are also made user-friendly with accessible tools. In addition, Flair
NLP provides an easy framework for training language models and is
compatible with HuggingFace.

</div>

#### **Training Models with HuggingFace via flaiR**

<div style="text-align: justify">

The following example offers a straightforward introduction on how to
fully train your own model using the Flair framework and import a `BERT`
model from [HuggingFace ðŸ¤—](https://github.com/huggingface). This
example utilizes grandstanding score as training data from Julia Parkâ€™s
paper (*[When Do Politicians Grandstand? Measuring Message Politics in
Committee
Hearings](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/709147?journalCode=jop&mobileUi=0)*)
and trains the model using Transformer-based models via flair NLP
through `{flaiR}`.

<u>**Step 1**</u> Split Data into Train and Test Sets with `flair`
Sentence Object

``` r
# load training data: grandstanding score from Julia Park's paper
library(flaiR)
data(gs_score) 
```

``` r
# load flair functions via flaiR
Sentence <- flair_data()$Sentence
Corpus <- flair_data()$Corpus
TransformerDocumentEmbeddings <- flair_embeddings()$TransformerDocumentEmbeddings
TextClassifier <- flair_models()$TextClassifier
ModelTrainer <- flair_trainers()$ModelTrainer
```

``` r
# split the data
text <- lapply(gs_score$speech, Sentence)
labels <- as.character(gs_score$rescaled_gs)

for (i in 1:length(text)) {
  text[[i]]$add_label("classification", labels[[i]])
}

set.seed(2046)
sample <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), length(text), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.8, 0.2))
train  <- text[sample]
test   <- text[!sample]
```

<u>**Step 2**</u> Preprocess Data and Corpus Object

``` r
corpus <- Corpus(train=train, test=test)
#> 2023-11-28 13:14:49,956 No dev split found. Using 0% (i.e. 282 samples) of the train split as dev data
```

<u>**Step 3**</u> Create Classifier Using Transformer

``` r
document_embeddings <- TransformerDocumentEmbeddings('distilbert-base-uncased', fine_tune=TRUE)
```

`$make_label_dictionary` function is used to create a label dictionary
for the classification task. The label dictionary is a mapping from
label to index, which is used to map the labels to a tensor of label
indices. expcept classifcation task, flair also supports other label
types for training custom model, such as `ner`, `pos` and `sentiment`.

``` r
label_dict <- corpus$make_label_dictionary(label_type="classification")
#> 2023-11-28 13:14:51,649 Computing label dictionary. Progress:
#> 2023-11-28 13:14:51,698 Dictionary created for label 'classification' with 2 values: 0 (seen 1332 times), 1 (seen 1202 times)
```

`$item2idx` method to check the mapping from label to index. This is
very important to make sure the labels are mapped correctly to the
indices and tensors.

``` r
label_dict$item2idx
#> $`b'0'`
#> [1] 0
#> 
#> $`b'1'`
#> [1] 1
```

`TextClassifier` is used to create a text classifier. The classifier
takes the document embeddings (importing from `'distilbert-base-uncased`
from HugginFace) and the label dictionary as input. The label type is
also specified as classification.

``` r
classifier <- TextClassifier(document_embeddings,
                             label_dictionary=label_dict, 
                             label_type='classification')
```

<u>**Step 4**</u> Start Training

specific computation devices on your local machine. If you have a GPU,
you can use `flair_gpu` to specify the GPU device. If you donâ€™t have a
GPU, you can use `flaiR::flair_device` to specify the CPU device.

``` r
classifier$to(flair_device("cpu")) 
#> TextClassifier(
#>   (embeddings): TransformerDocumentEmbeddings(
#>     (model): DistilBertModel(
#>       (embeddings): Embeddings(
#>         (word_embeddings): Embedding(30523, 768)
#>         (position_embeddings): Embedding(512, 768)
#>         (LayerNorm): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True)
#>         (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
#>       )
#>       (transformer): Transformer(
#>         (layer): ModuleList(
#>           (0-5): 6 x TransformerBlock(
#>             (attention): MultiHeadSelfAttention(
#>               (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
#>               (q_lin): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)
#>               (k_lin): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)
#>               (v_lin): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)
#>               (out_lin): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=768, bias=True)
#>             )
#>             (sa_layer_norm): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True)
#>             (ffn): FFN(
#>               (dropout): Dropout(p=0.1, inplace=False)
#>               (lin1): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=3072, bias=True)
#>               (lin2): Linear(in_features=3072, out_features=768, bias=True)
#>               (activation): GELUActivation()
#>             )
#>             (output_layer_norm): LayerNorm((768,), eps=1e-12, elementwise_affine=True)
#>           )
#>         )
#>       )
#>     )
#>   )
#>   (decoder): Linear(in_features=768, out_features=2, bias=True)
#>   (dropout): Dropout(p=0.0, inplace=False)
#>   (locked_dropout): LockedDropout(p=0.0)
#>   (word_dropout): WordDropout(p=0.0)
#>   (loss_function): CrossEntropyLoss()
#> )
```

`ModelTrainer` is used to train the model, which learns from the data
based on the grandstanding score.

``` r
trainer <- ModelTrainer(classifier, corpus)
```

``` r
trainer$train('grand_standing_model',          # output directory
              learning_rate=0.02,              # learning rate: if batch_growth_annealing activates,lr should starts a bit higher.
              mini_batch_size=8L,              # batch size
              anneal_with_restarts = TRUE,
              save_final_model=TRUE,
              max_epochs=3L)                   # Maximum number of epochs
```

<u>**Step 5**</u> Evaluate the Model

During and after the model training process, evaluating the performance
of the trained model on the development set is straightforward and easy.

``` r
# import the performance metrics generated during the training process
performance_df <- read.table(file = "grand_standing/loss.tsv", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
head(performance_df)
#>   EPOCH TIMESTAMP LEARNING_RATE TRAIN_LOSS DEV_LOSS DEV_PRECISION DEV_RECALL
#> 1     1  13:07:11          0.02     0.6071   0.6314        0.7250     0.7250
#> 2     2  13:11:19          0.02     0.4509   0.6139        0.7393     0.7393
#> 3     3  13:21:47          0.02     0.3294   0.6228        0.7464     0.7464
#> 4     4  13:25:03          0.02     0.2513   0.6628        0.7393     0.7393
#> 5     5  13:28:10          0.02     0.1109   0.6920        0.7429     0.7429
#> 6     6  13:31:16          0.02     0.0553   0.7023        0.7429     0.7429
#>   DEV_F1 DEV_ACCURACY
#> 1 0.7250       0.7250
#> 2 0.7393       0.7393
#> 3 0.7464       0.7464
#> 4 0.7393       0.7393
#> 5 0.7429       0.7429
#> 6 0.7429       0.7429
```

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(performance_df, aes(x = EPOCH)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = TRAIN_LOSS, color = "Training Loss")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = DEV_LOSS, color = "Development Loss")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = DEV_RECALL, color = "Development Recall")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = DEV_F1, color = "Development F1")) +

  labs(title = "Training and Development Loss per Epoch",
       x = "Epoch / Grandstanding Classifier",
       y = "")  +
  scale_color_manual("", 
                     values = c("Training Loss" = "blue",
                                "Development Loss" = "red",
                                "Development F1" = "green"))+
  theme_minimal() 
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="100%" />

<u>**Step 6**</u> Apply the Trained Model on Unseen Data for Prediction

We use the statement in the dataset as an example.

``` r
# load the trained model
data(statements)
Sentence <- flair_data()$Sentence

text <- statements[1, "Statement"]
sentence <- Sentence(text)
```

`lassifier$predict function is used to predict the label of the sentence. The function returns a sentence object with the predicted label.`

``` r
classifier$predict(sentence)
print(sentence)
#> Sentence[55]: "Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today not just as a legislator, but as a defender of our very way of life! We are facing a crisis of monumental proportions, and if we don't act now, the very fabric of our society will unravel before our eyes!" â†’ 1 (0.7514)
```

`sentence$labels` is a list of labels, each of which has a value and a
score. The value is the label itself, and the score is the probability
of the label. The label with the highest score is the predicted label.

``` r
sentence$labels[[1]]$value
#> [1] "1"
```

``` r
sentence$labels[[1]]$score
#> [1] 0.751438
```

<u>**Step 7**</u> Reload the Model with the Best Performance

When you train the model with `save_final_model=TRUE`, the model with
the best performance on the development set will be saved in the output
directory. You can reload the model with the best performance using the
`load` function.

``` r
Sentence <- flair_data()$Sentence
TextClassifier <- flair_models()$TextClassifier
classifier <- TextClassifier$load('grand_standing/best-model.pt')
```

We can create a function to classify the text using the specified Flair
classifier.

``` r
classify_text <- function(text, classifier) {
  # Classifies the given text using the specified Flair classifier.
  #
  # Args:
  # text (str): The text to be classified.
  # classifier (TextClassifier): The Flair classifier to use for prediction.
  #
  # Returns:
  #   list: A list containing the predicted class label and score as strings.  
  sentence <- Sentence(text)
  classifier$predict(sentence)
  return(list (labels  = sentence$labels[[1]]$value, score  = as.character(sentence$labels[[1]]$score)))
  }
```

Before performing classication tast, letâ€™s quickly check the dataset.

``` r
data(statements)
print(statements)
#>                                        Type
#> 1                Dramatic Appeal to Emotion
#> 2      Exaggerated Praise for a Local Issue
#> 3 Over-Simplified Solution to Complex Issue
#> 4             Personal Anecdote Over Policy
#> 5               Blaming Political Opponents
#>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Statement
#> 1 Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you today not just as a legislator, but as a defender of our very way of life! We are facing a crisis of monumental proportions, and if we don't act now, the very fabric of our society will unravel before our eyes!
#> 2                  I want to bring attention to the extraordinary achievement of the Smallville High School baseball team. Their victory is not just a win for Smallville, but a symbol of hope for our nation! This is what true American spirit looks like!
#> 3                                               The solution to our nation's economic struggles is simple: cut taxes. That's it. Cut them. The economy will skyrocket like never before. Why complicate things when the answer is right there in front of us?
#> 4                        I remember, back in my hometown, old Mr. Jenkins used to say, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' That's exactly how I feel about our current healthcare system. We don't need reform; we just need good, old-fashioned common sense.
#> 5                                                     Every problem we face today can be traced back to the disastrous policies of the other party. They are the reason we are in this mess, and until we recognize that, we cannot move forward as a nation.
```

Letâ€™s apply the function to the dataset.

``` r
for (i in seq_along(statements$Statement) ) {
  out_come <- classify_text(statements$Statement[[i]], classifier)
  statements[i, 'predicted_labels'] <- out_come[[1]]
  statements[i, 'prop_score'] <- out_come[[2]]
}
```

``` r
statements[c("Type", "predicted_labels", "prop_score")]
#>                                        Type predicted_labels        prop_score
#> 1                Dramatic Appeal to Emotion                1 0.998062312602997
#> 2      Exaggerated Praise for a Local Issue                1 0.985962450504303
#> 3 Over-Simplified Solution to Complex Issue                1 0.967254757881165
#> 4             Personal Anecdote Over Policy                1 0.998513281345367
#> 5               Blaming Political Opponents                1 0.999097466468811
```

Secondly, to facilitate more efficient use for social science research,
{`flairR`} expands {`flairNLP/flair`}â€™s core functionality for working
with three major functions to extract features in a tidy and fast
formatâ€“
[data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html)
in R.

#### **Performing NLP Tasks in R**

<div style="text-align: justify">

The expanded features (and examples) can be found:

- [**part-of-speech
  tagging**](https://davidycliao.github.io/flaiR/articles/get_pos.html)
- [**named entity
  recognition**](https://davidycliao.github.io/flaiR/articles/get_entities.html)
- [**transformer-based sentiment
  analysis**](https://davidycliao.github.io/flaiR/articles/get_sentiments.html)

In addition, to handle the load on RAM when dealing with larger corpus,
{`flairR`} supports batch processing to handle texts in batches, which
is especially useful when dealing with large datasets, to optimize
memory usage and performance. The implementation of batch processing can
also utilize GPU acceleration for faster computations.
