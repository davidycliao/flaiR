I also welcome my hon. Friends on the <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: black; font-family: Arial\">Back Benches<\/span> <span style=\"color: orange; font-family: Arial\">(MISC)<\/span>. Immigration is the most important issue for my constituents. I get more complaints, comments and suggestions about immigration than about anything else. In the <span style=\"background-color: lightblue; color: black; font-family: Arial\">Kettering<\/span> <span style=\"color: blue; font-family: Arial\">(LOC)<\/span> constituency, the number of immigrants is actually very low. There is a well-settled <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: black; font-family: Arial\">Sikh<\/span> <span style=\"color: orange; font-family: Arial\">(MISC)<\/span> community in the middle of <span style=\"background-color: lightblue; color: black; font-family: Arial\">Kettering<\/span> <span style=\"color: blue; font-family: Arial\">(LOC)<\/span> town itself, which has been in <span style=\"background-color: lightblue; color: black; font-family: Arial\">Kettering<\/span> <span style=\"color: blue; font-family: Arial\">(LOC)<\/span> for some 40 or 50 years and is very much part of the local community and of the fabric of local life. There are other very small migrant groups in my constituency, but it is predominantly made up of indigenous <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: black; font-family: Arial\">British<\/span> <span style=\"color: orange; font-family: Arial\">(MISC)<\/span> people. However, there is huge concern among my constituents about the level of immigration into our country. I believe that I am right in saying that, in recent years, net immigration into the <span style=\"background-color: lightblue; color: black; font-family: Arial\">United Kingdom<\/span> <span style=\"color: blue; font-family: Arial\">(LOC)<\/span> is the largest wave of immigration that our country has ever known and, proportionately, is probably the biggest wave of immigration since the <span style=\"background-color: yellow; color: black; font-family: Arial\">Norman<\/span> <span style=\"color: orange; font-family: Arial\">(MISC)<\/span> conquest. My contention is that our country simply cannot cope with immigration on that scale-to coin a phrase, we simply cannot go on like this. It is about time that mainstream politicians started airing the views of their constituents, because for too long people have muttered under their breath that they are concerned about immigration. They have been frightened to speak out about it because they are frightened of being accused of being racist. My contention is that immigration is not a racist issue; it is a question of numbers. I personally could not care tuppence about the ethnicity of the immigrants concerned, the colour of their skin or the language that they speak. What I am concerned about is the very large numbers of new arrivals to our country. My contention is that the <span style=\"background-color: lightblue; color: black; font-family: Arial\">United Kingdom<\/span> <span style=\"color: blue; font-family: Arial\">(LOC)<\/span> simply cannot cope with them.<\/div>"},{"path":"https://davidycliao.github.io/flaiR/reference/load_tagger_ner.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Load the Named Entity Recognition (NER) Tagger — load_tagger_ner","title":"Load the Named Entity Recognition (NER) Tagger — load_tagger_ner","text":"helper function load appropriate tagger based provided language. function supports variety languages/models.","code":""},{"path":"https://davidycliao.github.io/flaiR/reference/load_tagger_ner.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Load the Named Entity Recognition (NER) Tagger — load_tagger_ner","text":"","code":"load_tagger_ner(language = NULL)"},{"path":"https://davidycliao.github.io/flaiR/reference/load_tagger_ner.html","id":"arguments","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Arguments","title":"Load the Named Entity Recognition (NER) Tagger — load_tagger_ner","text":"language character string indicating desired language NER tagger. `NULL`, function default 'pos-fast' model.
