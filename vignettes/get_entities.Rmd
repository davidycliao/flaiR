## An Example Using `ner` Model (Pre-trained NER English Model)

### Generic Approach Using `get_entities()`

```{r}
library(flaiR)
data("uk_immigration")
uk_immigration <- head(uk_immigration, 20)
```

Use `load_tagger_ner` to call the NER pretrained model. The model will be downloaded from Flair's Hugging Face repo. Thus, ensure you have an internet connection. Once downloaded, the model will be stored in __.flair__ as the cache in your device. So, once you've downloaded it and it hasn't been manually removed, executing the command again will not trigger a download.

```{r}
tagger_pos <- flaiR::load_tagger_ner("ner")
```

If you want the computation to run faster, it is recommended to keep the show.text_id set to FALSE by default. 

```{r setup}
time <- system.time({
    results <- get_entities(uk_immigration$text,
                            uk_immigration$speaker, 
                            tagger_pos)
    gc()
})


print(time)
```


```{r}
print(results)
```

### Batch Processing  Using `get_entities_batch()`

```{r}
batch_process_time <- system.time({
    batch_process_results  <- get_entities_batch(uk_immigration$text,
                                                 uk_immigration$speaker, 
                                                 tagger_pos,
                                                 batch_size = 5)
    gc()
})
print(batch_process_time)


```

```{r}
print(batch_process_results)
```

Comparing the two sets of timings, the batch process slightly faster than the process without batching when processing larger amount of data.
```{r}
time_difference <- time["elapsed"] - batch_process_time["elapsed"]
print(time_difference)
```
