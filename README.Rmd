`{flaiR}` is an R wrapper for the [{flairNLP/flair}](https://github.com/flairnlp/flair) library in Python, designed specifically for R users, especially those in the social sciences. It provides easy access to the main functionalities of `{flairNLP}`. Developed by Developed by [Zalando Research](https://engineering.zalando.com/posts/2018/11/zalando-research-releases-flair.html) in Berlin, Flair NLP offers intuitive interfaces and exceptional multilingual support, particularly for various embedding frameworks and state-of-the-art natural language processing models to analyze your text, such as named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, biomedical data, sense disambiguation, and classification, with support for a rapidly growing number of languages in the community. In addition, Flair NLP provides an easy framework for training language models and is compatible with HuggingFace. For a comprehensive understanding of the `{flairNLP/flair}` architecture, you can refer to the research article '[Contextual String Embeddings for Sequence Labeling](https://aclanthology.org/C18-1139.pdf)' and the official [manual](https://flairnlp.github.io) written for its Python implementation. 

For R users, {`flairR`} primarily consists of two main components. The first is wrapper functions in {`flaiR`} built on top of {`reticulate`}, which enables you to interact directly with Python modules in R and provides seamless support for documents and [tutorial (in progress)](https://davidycliao.github.io/flaiR/articles/tutorial.html) in the R community. The {flaiR} package enables R users to leverage Flair's capabilities to train their own models using the Flair framework and state-of-the-art NLP models without the need to interact directly with Python.

Secondly, to facilitate more efficient use for social science research, {`flairR`} expands {`flairNLP/flair`}'s core functionality for working with three major functions to extract features in a tidy and fast format-- [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html) in R. 

The expanded features (and examples) can be found: 

- [**part-of-speech tagging**](https://davidycliao.github.io/flaiR/articles/get_pos.html)
- [**named entity recognition**](https://davidycliao.github.io/flaiR/articles/get_entities.html)
- [**transformer-based sentiment analysis**](https://davidycliao.github.io/flaiR/articles/get_sentiments.html)

In addition, to handle the load on RAM when dealing with larger corpus, {`flairR`}  supports batch processing to handle texts in batches, which is especially useful when dealing with large datasets, to optimize memory usage and performance. The implementation of batch processing can also utilize GPU acceleration for faster computations.

### Installation via  <u>__`GitHub`__</u>

<div style="text-align: justify">

The installation consists of two parts: First, install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher, and [R 3.6.3](https://www.r-project.org) or higher. Although we have tested it on Github Action with R 3.6.2, we strongly recommend installing [R 4.0.0 or above](https://github.com/davidycliao/flaiR/actions/runs/6416611291) to ensure compatibility between the R environment and {`reticulate`}. When first installed, {flaiR} automatically creates a virtual environment named `flair_env` through {reticulate} in R. The purpose of this is to prevent conflicts with dependencies required by flair that might arise from other packages installed on your system, and to ensure that pip can successfully collect all the dependencies needed for Flair NLP. If there are any issues with the installation, feel free to ask in the <u>[Discussion](https://github.com/davidycliao/flaiR/discussions) </u>.
