## Install `flaiR` with Using [`remotes`](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes)

<div style="text-align: justify">

`flaiR` is built on top of the [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package and incorporates key features of the Flair library, returning data in a tidy and efficient[`data.table`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html) format. The installation consists of two parts: First, install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher, and the[`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package in R. Additionally, you'll also need [`Anaconda`](Anaconda) to assist `reticulate` in setting up your Python environment, as well as enabling your RStudio to identify the environment.

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("davidycliao/flaiR", force = TRUE)
library(flaiR)
```
```
 flaiR: An R Wrapper for Accessing Flair NLP Tagging Features      
 Python : 3.11  
```

If this is your first time using Python-related packages in like flair with R (`flaiR`), __it's highly likely that you haven't yet installed a Conda environment.__ When you are loading `flaiR` in R, it automatically goes through two steps. First, it creates a conda environment called ___r-reticulate___, during which you'll see a lot of messages related to the installation of the Python environment. Afterward, you will see the message __"Virtual environment 'r-reticulate' successfully created."__ Next, you will be prompted to confirm whether or not you want to use r-reticulate. Enter __"Yes,"__ and it will automatically install Python `flaiR`.

```
 Python : 3.11                                           
 Flair: âœ—                                     
 Flair is installing from Python
```

<!-- To utilize flairR in R, you need to first install the Python-based Flair NLP library. This can be done using `reticulate.` It's recommended to have Python version 3.7 or higher installed to ensure smooth operation of [`fliar`](https://flairnlp.github.io) in Python. -->

## Quick Use

### __Tagging Parts-of-Speech with Flair Models__

<div style="text-align: justify">

Load the pretrained model "pos-fast". For more pretrained models, see https://flairnlp.github.io/docs/tutorial-basics/part-of-speech-tagging#-in-english. 

</div>

```{r}
texts <- c("UCD is one of the best universities in Ireland.",
           "UCD has a good campus but is very far from my apartment in Dublin.",
           "Essex is famous for social science research.",
           "Essex is not in the Russell Group, but it is famous for political science research and in 1994 Group.",
           "TCD is the oldest university in Ireland.",
           "TCD is similar to Oxford.")

doc_ids <- c("doc1", "doc2", "doc3", "doc4", "doc5", "doc6")
```

```{r}
library(flaiR)
```

```{r}
tagger_pos <- load_tagger_pos("pos-fast")
```

```{r}
results <- get_pos(texts, doc_ids, tagger_pos)
head(results, n = 10)
```


### __Tagging Entities with Flair Models__

<div style="text-align: justify">

Load the pretrained model "ner". For more pretrained models, see https://flairnlp.github.io/docs/tutorial-basics/tagging-entities.

</div>

```{r}
library(flaiR)
```

```{r}
tagger_ner <- load_tagger_ner("ner")
```

```{r}
results <- get_entities(texts, doc_ids, tagger_ner)
head(results, n = 10)
```

### __Tagging Sentiment__

<div style="text-align: justify">
Load the pretrained model "`sentiment`". The pre-trained models of "`sentiment`", "`sentiment-fast`", and "`de-offensive-language`" are currently available. For more pretrained models, see https://flairnlp.github.io/docs/tutorial-basics/tagging-sentiment.

</div>

```{r}
library(flaiR)
```

```{r}
tagger_sent <- load_tagger_sentiments("sentiment")
```


```{r}
results <- get_sentiments(texts, doc_ids, tagger_sent)
head(results, n = 10)
```
