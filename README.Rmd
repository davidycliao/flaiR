`{flaiR}` is a R wrapper of the {FlairNLP} for R users, particularly for social science researchers. It offers streamlined access to the core features of `FlairNLP` from Python. FlairNLP is an advanced NLP framework that incorporates the latest techniques developed by the Humboldt University of Berlin. For a deeper understanding of Flair’s architecture, refer to the research article ‘[Contextual String Embeddings for Sequence Labeling](https://aclanthology.org/C18-1139.pdf)’ and the official [mannual](https://flairnlp.github.io) in Python. 

For R users, {`flairR`} primarily consists of two main components. The first is a wrapper function built on top of {`reticulate`}, which enables you to interact directly with Python modules in R and provides seamless support for documents in the R community. Secondly, to facilitate more efficient use for social science research, {`flairR`} wraps the FlairNLP Python  with three major functions to extract features in a tidy and clean format using [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html). The features include [**part-of-speech tagging**](https://davidycliao.github.io/flaiR/articles/get_pos.html), [**transformer-based sentiment analysis**](https://davidycliao.github.io/flaiR/articles/get_entities.html), and [**named entity recognition**](https://davidycliao.github.io/flaiR/articles/get_sentiments.html).

### Installation via  <u>__`GitHub`__</u>

<div style="text-align: justify">

The installation consists of two parts: First, install [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher, and [R 3.6.3](https://www.r-project.org) or higher. Although we have tested it on Github Action with R 3.6.2, we strongly recommend installing [R 4.0.0 or above](https://github.com/davidycliao/flaiR/actions/runs/6416611291) to ensure compatibility between the R environment and {`reticulate`}. If there are any issues with the installation, feel free to ask in the <u>[Discussion](https://github.com/davidycliao/flaiR/discussions) </u>.

</div>

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("davidycliao/flaiR", force = TRUE)
```

```r
library(flaiR)
#> flaiR: An R Wrapper for Accessing Flair NLP Tagging Features
