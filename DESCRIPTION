Description: This is an R wrapper based on the structure of reticulate in R, designed 
             to access the major features of flairNLP in Python. Flair NLP is a 
             powerful framework for state-of-the-art Natural Language 
             Processing. The features in flaiR currently include part-of-speech 
             tagging, sentiment tagging, and named entity recognition tagging. 
             This package requires Python 3.7 or above to operate concurrently.
