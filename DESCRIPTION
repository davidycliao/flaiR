Description: Provides a suite of intuitive and flexible wrapper tools tailored 
             for accessing FLAIR in Python data analysis. The package is an R wrapper 
             designed to provide access to the primary features of FLAIR. 
             FLAIR  is an advanced framework for state-of-the-art natural language 
             processing tasks and sequence tagging. FLAIR offers features such as 
             part-of-speech tagging, transformer-based sentiment analysis, 
             and named entity recognition. To function properly, this package
